# Global Copilot Instructions

## File Creation Rules

**NEVER create markdown (.md) files unless the user EXPLICITLY asks for documentation.**

When working on code:
- Use tools to edit/create code files directly
- Do NOT create README.md, SUMMARY.md, RECAP.md, STATUS.md, or any .md files automatically
- If you need to show information, explain it in the response instead
- Only create .md files when the user specifically requests documentation

Example of what NOT to do:
- ❌ "I'll create a RECAP.md to summarize..."
- ❌ "Let me document this in a STATUS.md..."
- ❌ Creating markdown files for summaries, recaps, or documentation without being asked

Example of what to do:
- ✅ Edit code files directly with the tools
- ✅ Explain changes in the response
- ✅ Only create .md if user says "create documentation" or "write a README" or similar explicit request

**This rule applies to ALL interactions unless explicitly overridden by the user.**

## Database Management Rules

**NEVER perform a FULL DATABASE RESET that deletes ALL data unless explicitly requested by the user.**

When working with database:
- ✅ Migrations are OK (e.g., adding a new field with a default value like `false`)
- ✅ Schema updates that preserve existing data are OK
- ✅ Adding new tables/columns is OK
- ✅ Updating specific records is OK
- ❌ NEVER run `prisma migrate reset` or equivalent commands that wipe all data
- ❌ NEVER delete all records from tables without explicit user confirmation
- ❌ NEVER suggest solutions that require losing all existing data

If a migration requires data transformation:
- Create a migration script that preserves and transforms existing data
- Default new fields to appropriate values based on existing data
- Only suggest data-destructive operations if there's absolutely no other way, and wait for explicit user approval

Example of what NOT to do:
- ❌ "Let's reset the database to apply this change"
- ❌ Running `prisma migrate reset` without asking
- ❌ Suggesting to delete all data and start fresh

Example of what to do:
- ✅ "I'll create a migration that adds the new column with a default value"
- ✅ "This migration will preserve your existing data and set the new field to `false` by default"
- ✅ "We can add this field without losing any data"

**This rule is CRITICAL - data loss can be catastrophic for users.**
